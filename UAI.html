    <h1>Up Arrow</h1>
    <p style="font-size: 2.5vw;">We all know how Multiplication is just repeated Addition, and that Exponation is just repeated Multiplication,
        but what is repeated Exponation? This is where Knuth’s Up Arrow Notation comes in, Knuth’s Up Arrow Notation
        allows you to perform “Hyperoperations” one example of this is 2<sup>2<sup>2<sup>2<sup>2</sup></sup></sup></sup> this is a big number but there is
        another way to write it you can write it like this 2^^5. This is known as Tetration, but what about repeated
        tetration? Pentation of course! In Expanded form this is 2^^2^^2^^2^^2 but using Up Arrow Notation you can write
        it as 2^^^5 and you can go even further to Hexation where 2^^^2^^^2^^^2^^^2 can be written as 2^^^^2, since we
        do not have anymore words for bigger numbers we will write them out like this 2^52 this is equal to 2^^^^^2,
        let’s take this to the extreme. Start with 3^^^^3, already this is a massive number impossible to write out but
        we’ll just say this answer g<sub>0</sub> (3^^^^3 = g<sub>0</sub>). Now Hyperoperate 3 to g0 (3^g<sub>0</sub>3) or two 3’s with g<sub>0</sub> arrows, we can
        say this answer is g<sub>1</sub> (3^g<sub>0</sub>3 = g1). Now do the same thing again (3 Hyperoperated to g<sub>1</sub>), you can say this answer
        is g<sub>2</sub> keep repeating the process till you reach g<sub>64</sub> This number is incomprehensibly big and the main last number
        in this series so usually people capitalize it to G64. This is not the end though, you can take it farther to
        numbers like g<sub>65</sub> or even g<sub>Googol</sub> or, heck even g<sub>G64</sub>
