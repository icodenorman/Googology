  <h1 style="padding: 2vw; font-size: 8vw;">Googol Related Insanity</h1>
  <p style="font-size: 2vw;">Googol and its older brother, Googolplex, are the poster children for Googology as a whole.
    They are the classic big numbers, but let’s start with googol. Googol is THE big number, I mean who doesn’t know
    googol, though I think googol and its subsequent family aren’t very interesting, so this part will be short, googol
    is 1 followed by 100 zeroes which is
    10,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,<br>000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000
    and it is proven that this is more than the number of atoms in the entire universe. But this is just the start,
    let's go up one more to googolplex, which is written as 10<sup>10<sup>100</sup></sup> or
    <br>10
    <sup>10,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000</sup>.
    This number is almost-impossible to ever write, but we don’t have to end here.
    Then we can go to, Googolplexian which is written as 10<sup>10<sup>10<sup>100</sup></sup></sup> or 10 to the power
    of a googolplex, this number is incomprehensibly large, but we can go bigger. Googolplexianth is the next number in
    the series and continues to be a really big number written as
    10<sup>10<sup>10<sup>10<sup>100</sup></sup></sup></sup>. This number is so big that if you tried to comprehend it
    your brain would most likely explode! But this is not the end, we can go bigger.
